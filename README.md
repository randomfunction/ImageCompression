# Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

This project demonstrates how **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** can be used to compress grayscale images by retaining only the most significant singular values. The technique is implemented in Python using NumPy and skimage.

## Overview

- Load a high-resolution RGB image from the web
- Convert it to grayscale and resize to 256x256 for simplicity
- Apply SVD to decompose the image matrix
- Reconstruct compressed versions of the image using top `k` singular values
- Automatically find the optimal `k` based on:
  - **Energy retention â‰¥ 95%**
  - **SSIM â‰¥ 0.90**
- Visualize:
  - Original vs Compressed image
  - Singular values
  - Energy retention vs number of components `k`

## Compression Metrics

- **Energy Retention**: Measures how much of the imageâ€™s information is preserved using the top `k` singular values.
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Measures the perceptual similarity between the original and compressed image.

## Optimal `k` Selection

The script automatically selects the smallest `k` that satisfies both:
- Energy retention â‰¥ 95%
- SSIM â‰¥ 0.90

This balances image quality and compression efficiency.
